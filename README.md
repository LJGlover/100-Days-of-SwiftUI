# 100-Days-of-SwiftUI
Charting my progress through the 100 Days of SwiftUI challenge.

I decided to undertake this challenge after sornding the last few years working in the IT industry and gaining qualifications in AWS, Azure, SQL, and with the aim of fulfilling my long-held dream of being able to tell computers what to do and get a job writing code for Apple devices and their apps.

Feel free to message me if you like what you see - especially if you're a potential employer! 

Description of Code Snippets:
- On day two I wrote a short piece of code to convert a temperature in Celsius to Fahrenheit and output a statement detailing the result using string interpolation.
